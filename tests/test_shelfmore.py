"""That the game list goes on loading as somebody scrolls down it.

An IntersectionObserver reports crossings, not states. The end-of-list marker
was already intersecting when it asked for a chunk, and drawing that chunk
pushed it down but not past the 600px rootMargin -- so it was still
intersecting, nothing crossed anything, and no second callback ever came. The
list stopped on its first chunk showing "Loading more...", and scrolling could
not rescue it: the marker is the last thing in the list, so there is nothing
below it to scroll towards.

Runs at 1440x900 because that is where it bites. The grid is auto-fill, so a
desktop window gets eight columns and a 48-card chunk is six rows -- well
inside a screenful plus the margin. A phone gets two columns and twenty-four
rows, clears the margin, and always looked fine. Reported from a desktop.
